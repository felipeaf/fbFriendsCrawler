# fbFriendsCrawler
A simple crawler for get some info from facebook's friends.

There is no easy way in facebook to search all friends for some info like " I wanna find all my friends from new york". So I made this crawler, that make a CSV output with some info to simplify this kind of task =)

Configure the facebookConfig object in main.js with your login info and user base (users from we get the friends list).
